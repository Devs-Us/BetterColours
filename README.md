EpicColors allows you to configure additional color to the game as simple as creating a txt file!\
To get started, make sure you have `CustomColors.txt` file inside your Among Us game directory

#
### Adding colors
- Give a name for your color. If you want to add spaces in your color's name, just use _ to represent them.

      name;Acid_Green
- You are required to have RGB pattern of your custom color to add one. use `main;r,g,b` to specify crewmate's color. 
Here's the example with Red:124 Green:155 and Blue:10

      main;124,155,10
- The shadow of the crewmate will be automatically generated by decreasing the main color by 40%. However, if you wish to put custom RGB for your color's shadow, you can use `shadows;r,g,b` like the example below.

      shadows;101,116,10

#
### Optional options
- Add yourself as an author while in the lobby by using `author;<whatever you want to put under the ping in the lobby>`.

      author;Colors provided by SideSxope
